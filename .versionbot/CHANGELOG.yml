    - subject: Add metrics-agent for collecting server metrics.
      hash: 8be52e18cb3563e8df52775245104d6943fbe94f
      body: |
        The metrics are sent to a metrics proxy backend where it can be
        scraped by the balena-monitor.

        The metrics-agent requires cert-manager to generate the self-signed
        client certificate for authenticating to the backend.

                        Currently if a provided label has whitespace it
                        will be treated as two labels, and this often happens
                        when processing the board_name from sys.

        We have a lot more runner servers available now, and
        we don't have the need for containerized runners as
        much as VMs. The former is only enabled on a small set
        of private repos since they are insecure.

                We want to prevent the guest docker daemon from using the
                same default subnets as the host docker bridge, as that is how
                we currently access local services like registry cache.

                This is simpler to implement nested virtualization
                as we don't need to assign a subnet to every layer.

                It also frees up some space in the 10.[64-127].x.x subnet
                for docker address pools in a future change.

                        Golang and pongo templates are simply not the best

                        way to generate complex JSON from templates. Also the
                        documentaion

                        for both is lacking and a simple node script can do the
                        job.


                        If we find a need for templated config files for

                        other services we can introduce a confd s6 service.

                These tests are meant to provide ping results
                and dns lookups before verifying internet access.

                Starting the tests with an apt-get that may
                fail for any number of reasons makes troubleshooting
                the root cause difficult.

                So the required packages have been made available
                in the guest images upstream.

                        Some of these packages are used for unit tests
                        of the VM-based runners.

                        Also some of these packages are included in
                        the hosted GitHub runner images anyway.

        Disabling/not configuring IPv6 on backend infrastructure where it is
        supported, should not be allowed in 2024+.

        This unblocks CI testing of NFS server features where
        the nfsd module is not loaded by default in balenaOS.

        The containerized runners are already privileged, and only
        enabled on private repos, so this is not a security change.

                The jailer actually provides no additional protections

                beyond what a container already does when running as non-root

                with controlled caps.


                The jailer itself actually requires far more capabilities

                to be provided to the container.

                This gives the guest VM access to the Docker DNS proxy
                mounted in the host container.

                The advantages are the guest VM can now resolve
                services by name, like the registry cache, and it
                will use the Docker daemon upstream DNS settings rather
                than hardcoding our own.

                The previous implementation was creating an ext2 filesystem,
                not ext4, and this created issues at runtime.

                Now we will compress the source rootfs at build time,
                and unpack it directly onto a new ext4 rootfs mount at runtime.

                This also restores the ability to set the desired rootfs size.

                Once booted we setup networking, the guest rootfs,
                pre-register the runner and switch root.

                This speeds up boot, while improving
                security and keeping the kernel as read-only.

                It also allows clearing of known secrets before
                switching to the guest runtime.

                This reduces time from container start to VM boot,

                and reduces the overall image size deployed to the registry

                by packaging both the rootfs and vmlinux binaries as zstd
                compressed.


                The downside being that the rootfs maximum size can no longer

                be configured at runtime and must be set at build time.

                additional considerations to use 'exec su -' when replacing
                the current process with long-running processes that could be
                inspected at runtime.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the
                        second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that
                        concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()`
                        used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`.
                        So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all
                        the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail
                        before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not
                        in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed,
                        running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test
                        cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before.
                        For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers
                        of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image.
                        In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a
                        buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the
                        second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an
                        `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would
                        prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the
                        basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those
                        blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL,
                        instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the
                        `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        That 21kB LITERAL is the difference in size we saw in
                        the test results.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked
                        fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a
                        particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to
                        finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll
                        keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the
                        interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages
                        about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks
                        that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the
                        target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect
                        balenaEngine.

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream.
                        Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so
                        that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing
                        this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch
                        by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a
                        separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that
                        encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer
                        interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting
                        code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining
                        duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that
                        almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this
                        is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh`
                        as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing
                        any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for
                        two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                This allows us to test the runner service the same
                way we do in production, as a supervised service, rather
                than a background shell.

                This reverts commit d03050b49616748b31ae558a1233968b4b68ba58.

                Instead we will register QEMU binfmt on the host via a separate
                service.
