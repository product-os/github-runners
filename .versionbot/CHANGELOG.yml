                This way we can optionally set ACTIONS_RUNNER_AUTH_TOKEN as a PAT

                on the repo and avoid using the token provided by Flowzone.

        This reverts the changes in PR #54, as sysctls can only be used with
        namespaced kernel parameters. The sysctl call will be performed in
        https://github.com/balena-io/balena-builder-worker instead.
