                      hash: 84471473ce02a0b8820e13105f845b67c19903c9

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()` used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`. So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed, running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before. For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image. In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL, instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                    - subject: Simplify and improve delta error handling
                      hash: 2c972dff108a153896116b07798bbc959c07ef01

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream. Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh` as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                This allows us to test the runner service the same
                way we do in production, as a supervised service, rather
                than a background shell.

                on the repo and avoid using the token provided by Flowzone.

                This reverts commit d03050b49616748b31ae558a1233968b4b68ba58.

                Instead we will register QEMU binfmt on the host via a separate
                service.
